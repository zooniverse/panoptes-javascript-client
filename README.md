## Panoptes Client

A Javascript client for accessing the [Panoptes API](https://github.com/zooniverse/Panoptes).

### Installation

You can install the client from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/panoptes-client):

```npm install panoptes-client```

and use it with:

ES5

```
apiClient = require('panoptes-client/lib/api-client');
auth = require('panoptes-client/lib/auth');
oauth = require('panoptes-client/lib/oauth');
talkClient = require('panoptes-client/lib/talk-client');
```

ES6

```
import apiClient from 'panoptes-client/lib/api-client'
import auth from 'panoptes-client/lib/auth'
import oauth from 'panoptes-client/lib/oauth'
import talkClient from 'panoptes-client/lib/talk-client'
```

### Documentation

The documentation for the library is available at [https://zooniverse.github.io/panoptes-javascript-client/](https://zooniverse.github.io/panoptes-javascript-client/). If there's anything missing, submit a PR!

#### Example usage

Here's [an example of how to use the Panoptes Javascript Client](https://gist.github.com/alexbfree/ad6a8ba66483f403dcb717099764ee13). You can run it by typing `node panoptes-javascript-client-example.js -u username -p password` where `username` and `password` are your Panoptes staging credentials. To use production, you just need to `export NODE_ENV=production` first.

#### Resource access

The Panoptes API is built on the very generically named [JSON API Spec](http://jsonapi.org/). This client leans heavily on [this library](https://github.com/zooniverse/json-api-client) to make it easy to access different resources that the API offers.
